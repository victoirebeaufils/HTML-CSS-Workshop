# HTML/CSS Workshop by Purdue WDC

For those that wish to review the content we talked about, I have linked the recording and the powerpoint below:

- [Powerpoint](https://github.com/victoirebeaufils/HTML-CSS-Workshop/blob/master/HTML_CSS%20Workshop.pptx)
- [Recording on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5CLrdAc5Yo&ab_channel=VictoireBeaufils)

The code we wrote is available in this repository.

I invite you to go check out [https://www.w3schools.com/html/](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) as they have endless ressources to get started with more HTML and CSS.

If you're looking for something that resembles a class environment a little bit more, [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) proposes challenges (including a portfolio challenge) to help you master HTML, CSS and many other web technologies.

Feel free to send me questions if you need any help!
